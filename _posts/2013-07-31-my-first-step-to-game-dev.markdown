As you know, I am currently researching about game development and have made 
some systems for RPG Maker VX Ace. In addition, I helped my friends and did 
commissions for other guys for their games; however, I have no game finished by 
myself. Anyway, this time I will talk about my first time making games instead of 
my work.

It was when I just graduated from secondary school and going to apply for high school. At that time, 
I was learning web designing and network security but I was really into programming, so [Keimoon](http://bunbunmaru.net/) - a guy who taught me many things in Information Technology - 
introduced me to coding and [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29). Nevertheless, I was really 
stupid that time and had no experience in programming so he advised me to try RPG Maker VX to practise with ruby and to 
learn about a program structure.

Consequently, I got addicted to RPG Maker. Firstly, learning something with a game was really exciting. Secondly, 
RPG Maker VX's framework - RGSS2 - was easy to understand so I perfectly learned Ruby and how a game works in 
a short time. However, I was really lazy and many things come up (one of that was my bad high school entrance exam result and 
I was nearly failed, luckily, they increased intake) so I dropped RPG Maker after two months.

Afterward, I started playing DotA again so this time, Warcraft III was my second "engine" in 
my game development story. At that time, RTS MOBA games were a trend in gaming, so I decided to 
make a custom map for Warcraft III too (of course it was an arena map). I learned [JASS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASS) 
and joined GameVN's Warcraft III box in order to learn making a custom map. Mostly users in that forum did not learn
JASS and only use Trigger GUI (a kind of eventing) to make a map's system so they were not really good and 
had a bad performance. In contrast, my programming knowledge helped me to make something that they couldn't do, 
a better performance and many unique skills for heroes. Sadly, that period only lasted for more than three months.

After a long time (about a year, i guess), I decided to make game with RPG Maker again and this time, Klaine - a friend of mine - 
introduced me Melody Engine, an awesome battle system for RPG Maker VX. I was really excited and started making my own game. Furthermore, 
I even learned photoshop for GUI designing and started making some small scripts for RPG Maker VX and Melody Engine. However, 
I was too excited to learn designing and programming so no game was made this time. 

I was reallly excited to make a game that time as a hobby, but I just only decided to stick with 
game development after a year (again, a year). In early 2012, I talked and made friends with [EvilEagles](http://sg.linkedin.com/in/hungvupixel/) (talked to him 
before, but only be his close friend in middle 2011), [Yanfly](http://yanflychannel.wordpress.com/), [Archeia](http://ph.linkedin.com/in/archeia/) and [Kread-EX](http://grimoirecastle.wordpress.com/), and found out that 
game development was a potential industry. Afterward, I decided to research and learn software 
engineering for game development. [Symphoria](http://symphonyan.org) - my blog at first, and we (me and EvilEagles) decided to make it 
as our games studio - was built soon after that.

It was a bit funny and surprised for me, my family and my friends because I decided to go for 
game development instead of web designing and network security (well, still computer though). 
My first step into game development lasted for three years, and now I'm going to have the next step 
and will have my own game soon.
