Recently, I have seen some projects that used pure C++ to develop. Even though it was not a bad thing, they forgot that in games development, debugging was the most important task and a compiling language couldn't provide such advantage like an interpreter ones. Some of you will wonder why, so I will list some main advantages in this article.

1. There are many choices of interpreter languages out there and almost of them are open source so you will have many solutions for your engine. Many of them are stable enough so you do not have to worry about your performance.
2. Most of them are much easy to learn so you do not have to get a hardcore programmer to code all the game logic. In addition, if you intend to make a game engine/framework, an interpreter language will be your choice because not many of developers are good at programming.
3. Some popular interpreter languages have a huge community and they are growing bigger and bigger so you will still have the support from many other programmers.
4. The most important reason is the debugging matter. Even you have a high-end computer, the compiling session still takes you some time, at least some seconds for compiling, while debugging with an embed interpreter language will take no time. I believe there is no one want to test AI while it takes at least ten seconds each time testing, exclude resources loading time.

Even though interpreter languages are slower, more memory-consuming than compiling languages, the differences are not huge. Compiling languages are much better in performance but they will takes you more time in maintenance and debugging. I believe there are many guys who want to show their skill in coding but players do not care about their skills, about their code and other developers will consider them muscle-head.
