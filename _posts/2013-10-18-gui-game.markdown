As I see some nowaday games, developers do not often see *Graphical User Interface* (**GUI**) as important as it should be. They only know how to make a beautiful GUI, add some eye-candy features and try to add as much as possible information on screen. In fact, people often find interest a game by how it looks; therefore, designing an eye-candy game is a must for each developer. However, many developers do not know that players would feel tired and annoyed when playing their games in a long time if they did not pay attention in playing experience.

Firstly, we will talk about the balance between UI and UX design. In a simple way, UI design is how we decorate the GUI, it will have information, images and some decorations; whilst UX design is how we design and organise the elements in GUI to give users the best experience. Talking about balance, it is hard to put UI and UX in the same weight because the developers should put themselves in players places to experience how they would feel. When focusing too much on UI, the developer would miss something in playing experience. For example, they want to put as much as possible information on screen, but they can either mis-categorize some information, or put too many unnecessary statistics on the screen. For other instance, some developers have a habit of putting many effects and eye-candy decorations on menu; as a result, players eyes often get tired and they will somewhat feel annoyed when playing too much.

Secondly, we will go further the process of UI design and how to make a good UI. A good UI should tell you what you need to do now, also what you can do; for example, when you take a look at above Warcraft III UI, you would know how to treat your current selecting units and also realize what they can do at that time. In addition, you should be able to find the information that you are looking for, it would be very bad if you made a status window which shown too many things on screen, sometimes you only want to check character's basic stats, like ATTACK and DEFEND, but the UI shows too much unnecessary things like "Monster Kills", "Playing Time", "Character Profile", ... on only ONE window.

<span class="caption">Oblivion - The fuck are those icons meaning?</span>


In other way, a good UI should tell you the information without reading too much instructions; for a simple game with little information, reading instructions is not so bad, but for a much complicating game like strategy or simulation genre, reading wall of text over and over again is such a pain in the ass. Moreover, players do not want to spend their time just to load a title screen or a menu, for some grinding-RPG game, no one wants to waste time just for recovery. And for the last thing, developers should give players some options to switch features and customize UI or even some shorten way like shortcut keys, there are many things that a part of people like whilst some other do not.

<span class="caption">DotA 2 - Even though it looks neat, the UI is still not good.</span>


Lastly, we will talk about above examples. For the first one - **Warcraft III**, it is very neat and beautiful, we know the HP/MP percentage of selecting units and know what we can do for those units. Blizzard did a great job on minimap, your own units are highlighted by white color, buildings and heroes have a little bit difference in their icons, and it is great that you will not get tired when looking too much at their minimap. For **DotA 2**, the minimap is a bit far from player's status, the icons are hard to see, mostly because of the colours, your eyes would get tired when playing it for a long time. Even though Blizzard did a great job in Warcraft III, their GUI in **World of Warcraft** was a shit. As you can see, you even cannot see your character because of those status windows, buff icons and skill icons.

In conclusion, even though game UI does not impact too much in gameplay, it still affects player experiences in game. You should always pay attention in UI design and note of how you feel while playing your game in a long time. A good UI is not only beautiful but also neat and informative too. Take your time and pay attention in the games you play.
