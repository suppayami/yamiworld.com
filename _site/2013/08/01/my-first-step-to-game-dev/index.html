<p><small><em>"This time I will talk about my first step into game development."</em></small></p>
<p>As you know, I am currently researching about game development and have made 
some systems for RPG Maker VX Ace. In addition, I helped my friends and did 
commissions for other guys for their games; however, I have no game finished by 
myself. Anyway, this time I will talk about my first time making games instead of 
my work.</p>

<p>It was when I just graduated from secondary school and going to apply for high school. At that time, 
I was learning web designing and network security but I was really into programming, so <a href="http://bunbunmaru.net/">Keimoon</a> - a guy who taught me many things in Information Technology - 
introduced me to coding and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29">Ruby</a>. Nevertheless, I was really 
stupid that time and had no experience in programming so he advised me to try RPG Maker VX to practise with ruby and to 
learn about a program structure.</p>

<p>Consequently, I got addicted to RPG Maker. Firstly, learning something with a game was really exciting. Secondly, 
RPG Maker VX&#39;s framework - RGSS2 - was easy to understand so I perfectly learned Ruby and how a game works in 
a short time. However, I was really lazy and many things come up (one of that was my bad high school entrance exam result and 
I was nearly failed, luckily, they increased intake) so I dropped RPG Maker after two months.</p>

<p>Afterward, I started playing DotA again so this time, Warcraft III was my second &quot;engine&quot; in 
my game development story. At that time, RTS MOBA games were a trend in gaming, so I decided to 
make a custom map for Warcraft III too (of course it was an arena map). I learned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASS">JASS</a> 
and joined GameVN&#39;s Warcraft III box in order to learn making a custom map. Mostly users in that forum did not learn
JASS and only use Trigger GUI (a kind of eventing) to make a map&#39;s system so they were not really good and 
had a bad performance. In contrast, my programming knowledge helped me to make something that they couldn&#39;t do, 
a better performance and many unique skills for heroes. Sadly, that period only lasted for more than three months.</p>

<p>After a long time (about a year, i guess), I decided to make game with RPG Maker again and this time, Klaine - a friend of mine - 
introduced me Melody Engine, an awesome battle system for RPG Maker VX. I was really excited and started making my own game. Furthermore, 
I even learned photoshop for GUI designing and started making some small scripts for RPG Maker VX and Melody Engine. However, 
I was too excited to learn designing and programming so no game was made this time. </p>

<p>I was reallly excited to make a game that time as a hobby, but I just only decided to stick with 
game development after a year (again, a year). In early 2012, I talked and made friends with <a href="http://sg.linkedin.com/in/hungvupixel/">EvilEagles</a> (talked to him 
before, but only be his close friend in middle 2011), <a href="http://yanflychannel.wordpress.com/">Yanfly</a>, <a href="http://ph.linkedin.com/in/archeia/">Archeia</a> and <a href="http://grimoirecastle.wordpress.com/">Kread-EX</a>, and found out that 
game development was a potential industry. Afterward, I decided to research and learn software 
engineering for game development. <a href="http://symphonyan.org">Symphoria</a> - my blog at first, and we (me and EvilEagles) decided to make it 
as our games studio - was built soon after that.</p>

<p>It was a bit funny and surprised for me, my family and my friends because I decided to go for 
game development instead of web designing and network security (well, still computer though). 
My first step into game development lasted for three years, and now I&#39;m going to have the next step 
and will have my own game soon.</p>
